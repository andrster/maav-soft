 * @brief The PID Controller
 *
 * @author Steven Schulte (spschul)
 *
 * @details The PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) class is used for
 * creating PID controllers. The PID controller sets its control variable based
 * off of the difference between the desired value and the actual value of some
 * input. It produces a new value for its control variable by scaling the error,
 * the change in error over time, and the accumulated error over time by
 * manually set gains.
