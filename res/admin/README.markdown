### Configure Ubuntu
If you have not already, make sure to run `bash/vehicle-copy-keys.sh` to copy
your public SSH key to the vehicle so you can do password-less login.

From the root of the repository, run `bash/vehicle-config.sh`. This will
launch ansible and configure the vehicle. You must have internet access in
order to run this, as it creates a python virtualenv and installs ansible.

## Deploy the Code
Run `bash/vehicle-deploy.sh`.
